# Nightlio
Nightlio was inspired by awesome mood-tracking apps like Daylio, but born out of frustration with aggressive subscription models, paywalls, and a lack of cross-platform access. I wanted a beautiful, effective tool to log my mood and journal my thoughts without compromising on privacy or being locked into a single device.
